## Technology Stack

EcoLearn is built using a modern and robust technology stack:

- **Backend**: Python 3.9+ with FastAPI framework
- **AI Model**: Anthropic's Language Model
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy with SQLite (easily scalable to PostgreSQL)
- **API Integrations**: OpenAQ, NOAA, GBIF
- **Data Visualization**: Plotly
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Version Control**: Git

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecolearn.git
   cd ecolearn
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```shell
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
   ```shell
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
   GOOGLE_CSE_ID=your_google_cse_id
   NOAA_API_KEY=your_noaa_api_key
   ```
   Replace `your_*_api_key` with your actual API keys.
